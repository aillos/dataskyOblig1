Traceroute discovers the path to a remote host by sending a series of packets with incrementally increasing Time-To-Live (TTL) values, starting from 1. 
The TTL value determines the maximum number of hops (routers traversed) a packet can take before it is discarded. 
Each time a packet is forwarded by a router, the TTL is decremented by 1. When the TTL reaches 0, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message back to the source. 
Traceroute uses these messages to identify each hop along the path to the destination. By increasing the TTL by 1 for each successive batch of packets, traceroute can build a list of routers that the packets traverse on their way to the target host. 
Once the packets reach the destination (identified when a "Destination Unreachable" or similar message is received), traceroute completes its path discovery.
In our testing we see how the packets are traversing, first through telia, then to twelve99 and later on to 1e100, which a google search tells us is google's search servers.
